List countries that are of interest.

Find what aspects are important for your situation, lifestyle, etc. For example, for me some were:
- geographical position:
    - weather (average temp for month, nr. of rain days, humidity) **important as weather is a constant factor in living quality)
    - sightseeing (how pretty is the country, how much variation it has, how big the travel distances are to inside and outside vacation destinations) **important to know both financial drain and time drain when going on holiday)
    - distance from family/friends/leaving country
- childcare and youth policies:
    - quality of education (nursery, primary, secondary, university)
    - amount of parental leave
- soft aspects:
    - food diversity
    - entry rules for pets
    - ease to transfer and certify education, drivers license
- social aspects:
    - healthcare price + quality
    - amount of holidays
    - pensions
    - corruption
    - crime
    - quality of public transport (eg. do I need to buy a car to move around once I arrive?) - how much does it cost to travel?
- economical aspects:
    - macro-economics metrics [GDP per hours worked (rough estimate of 'hustle culture'), GDP per capita (rough estimate of 'citizens wealth')GDP per foreign loans (rouch estimate of national currency evolution), etc]
    - taxes
    - housing market
    - rent
    - price per m2 of living space
    - medium-long term global beliefs in economy
- quality of life:
    - average salary for each person moving
    - A. % total difference in salary compared to leaving country (from https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm)
    - B. % total difference in rent compared to leaving country
    - C. % total difference in average costs (rent, groceries, commute) compared to leaving country (from https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living)
    - (A-B)/C - % difference in buying power/ lifestyle change
    - knowing approximate savings based on (A-B)/C, how much time it takes to buy an appartment/house?
- future-proofing:
    - each person's oppinion on the country
    - ease to integrate (how long does it take to get all necessary paperwork in order)
- short term aspects / setting up:
    - job opportunities for each person moving
    - ease to relocate and get monthly income
    - other unquantifiable aspects eg. relatives there that can help, friends etc.

- Conclusions:
    - write general feeling of country after making research (short ideas based on all above eg. where does this country excel at, do worst at)


1. Decide on non-negociables (what aspects are must haves, and will never want to break?). 
2. Fill in each of selected countrie's non negociables. 
3. Cut out all countries that do not meet non-negociables.
4. After filling rest of fields in these for all countries, start making decisions based on Conclusions field, to avoid comparing all the in (example, higher taxes than on average, but better social services, etc)
5. Go through all countries and decide what aspects are stronger than others. If feeling especially nerdy, could set weights to each
heading, and give scores, then calculate weighted averages and use that to score (to me it seems a bit of an overkill, and nitpicky, but whatever works for you).
6. Finished your tier list.
